ReputatorBot is a bot that allows users to award reputation points if a user has been helpful. It's main intention is to be used on help and advice subreddits to help indicate users who have a track record of providing useful solutions.

It allows the OP of a post, a mod or a trusted user to reply to a user and award them a point using a bot command, which will be stored as their user flair. The command can be customisable (by default it is !thanks).

The app gets triggered when a comment is posted or edited, but only will fire once per comment.

You can also set an optional post flair if a point is awarded, such as to mark the question as "Resolved".

Limitations:
* The optional leaderboard will not pull in points for users until this app awards one. If you have previously used /u/Clippy_Office_Asst or a similar bot to award reputation points in the past, this will make the leaderboard misleading.
* For flair setting options, if you specify both a CSS class and a flair template, the flair template will be used.

Suggestions:

You may wish to create an automod rule that detects phrases like "thank you" and similar in comments that do not have the trigger command, and reply suggesting that they use the command.

I strongly recommend using a command that is not going to be used in "normal" comments, to avoid awarding points accidentally. If you use a ! prefix e.g. !thanks, you will reduce the risk of accidental points awarding.

I recommend testing settings out on a test subreddit before deploying to a real subreddit for the first time.
